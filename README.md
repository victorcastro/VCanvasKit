## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate VCanvasKit into your Xcode project using Xcode, specify it in File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency:

```ogdl
https://github.com/victorcastro/VCanvasKit.git, :branch="main"
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `VCanvasKit` into your project manually. Put `Sources/VCanvasKit` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

## Requirements

- iOS 16.0+
- Xcode 14.0+ | Swift 5+
